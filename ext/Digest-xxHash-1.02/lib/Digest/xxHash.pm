Digest::xxHash - xxHash Implementation For Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Digest::xxHash qw[xxhash xxhash_hex];

    my $hash = xxhash( $data, $seed );
    my $hex  = xxhash_hex( $data, $seed );

    # OO remix!

    my $digest = Digest::xxHash->new( $seed );
    $digest->add( $data );
    $digest->add( $more_data );
    my $xxhash = $digest->digest( );
    my $xxhex  = $digest->digest_hex( );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides both a functional and an OO interface to xxHash
functions. xxHash is an extremely fast algorithm that claims to work at speeds
close to RAM limits.

=head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE

These functions are easy to use but aren't very flexible.

=head2 $h = xxhash( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 32 bit hash.

=head2 $h = xxhash_hex( $data, $seed )

Calculates a 32 bit hash and returns it as a hex string.

=head1 OO INTERFACE

The OO interface is a lot more flexible but less succinct.

=head2 $d = Digest::xxHash->new( $seed )

Returns a new Digest::xxHash object. This is a simple constructor.

=head2 $d->add( $data )

Adds data to the spool that will eventually be hashed. You may call this as
many times as needed.

=head2 $d->reset( )

This will reset the data L<added|/"$d-E<< gt >>add( $data )"> to the object.
This is great if you want to hash several pieces of data with the same seed.

=head2 $h = $d->digest( )

Calculates a 32 bit hash of the data L<added|/"$d-E<< gt >>add( $data )"> to
the object.

=head2 $h = $d->digest_hex( )

Calculates a 32 bit hash of the data L<added|/"$d-E<< gt >>add( $data )"> to
the object and returns it as a hex string.

=head1 SPEED

According to the xxhash project's website, when run in a single thread on a
32bit Windows 7 box with a 3GHz Core 2 Duo processor, xxhash looks a little
like:

Q.Score is a measure of "quality" of the hash function. It depends on
successfully passing
L<SMHasher test set|http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/wiki/SMHasher>. 10 is a
perfect score. Hash functions with a Q.score E<lt> 5 are not listed in this
table.

I don't actually care about the wrapper I've written.
